&lt;p&gt;I change my Linux distro more often than most people change their underwear. There is always something new to try, or that catches my eye. Or, that used to be the case anyways. I think I have finally found the home I have been searching for in &lt;a href=&quot;garudalinux.org&quot;&gt;Garuda Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-garuda-linux&quot;&gt;What is Garuda Linux?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garuda is an Arch based distro. So, you get that same feel, rolling releases, pacman, and all the other goodies. But, you get so, so much more. There is also an install tool so you don’t have to do Linux the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-version-should-i-get&quot;&gt;Which version should I get?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many options to choose from once you get to the download page. My personal favorite is the Dragonized Gaming Edition with KDE for the desktop. Not only is it gorgeous, but it is perfect for most games that I have tried out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a wonderful distro for gaming, and multimedia. It has made full use of the MSI GE63 Raider RGB 9SE I used to test it. It plays games like Ark Survival Evolved as well as Windows ever did, and Dark Souls 3 is as smooth as butter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ronbecker</name></author><category term="Linux" /><summary type="html">I will admit I have a distro addiction.

&lt;p&gt;Short and sweet? journ is a command line journal written in Python. journ is completely run in your terminal. To use it after installing, just type journ in your terminal, and hit enter. Currently journ only uses the file journ.txt that it creates the first time you run it. In the future I want to add the ability to choose where you want your file, and what you want to name it. journ will append each new entry to the bottom of your journal file, along with the date and time the entry was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changelog&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ronbecker/journ/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt; on Github.

&lt;p&gt;And, I really hope that you can be patient with it. I have grabbed a new Jekyll theme based on the default theme for ghost. And, it’s amazing! But, it does take a little effort to get the hang of. For me at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please, just give it a day or two, and then all should be done and ready.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ronbecker</name></author><category term="News and Updates" /><summary type="html">We are doing a bit of a remodel</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello, World!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/welcome" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello, World!" /><published>2021-01-18T04:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-18T04:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/welcome</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/welcome">&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-probably-wondering-where-the-hell-youve-ended-up&quot;&gt;You’re probably wondering where the hell you’ve ended up.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a very, very good question. Now is your chance to run off to Google, or Reddit. Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you actually stuck around? I’m sorry… now you are doomed to reading this garbage. Well, since you’re here I may as well explain who I am, and what I plan to do around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-name-is-ron-becker&quot;&gt;My name is Ron Becker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I love to learn about, talk about, and share information about a variety of fields. You may run across posts covering everything from CyberSec, SysAdmin, Linux, Web Development, and more. My interests, and hobbies are luckily pretty varied. Unlike my skill set… I have been working with computers, coding, and various IT and SysAdmin jobs for the last 12 years or so. Surprisingly I still suck at it all, and don’t know very much. But, this blog is how I intend to change that. If I force myself to write about and use the knowledge I gather I hope that it will “stick” a little better, and I will get better at putting it into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that something in here will help you, or someone you know on their journey to learn more as well!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ronbecker</name></author><category term="News and Updates" /><summary type="html">You’re probably wondering where the hell you’ve ended up.</summary></entry></feed>
