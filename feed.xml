&lt;p&gt;Short and sweet? journ is a command line journal written in Python. journ is completely run in your terminal. To use it after installing, just type journ in your terminal, and hit enter. Currently journ only uses the file journ.txt that it creates the first time you run it. In the future I want to add the ability to choose where you want your file, and what you want to name it. journ will append each new entry to the bottom of your journal file, along with the date and time the entry was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changelog&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a very, very good question. Now is your chance to run off to Google, or Reddit. Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you actually stuck around? I’m sorry… now you are doomed to reading this garbage. Well, since you’re here I may as well explain who I am, and what I plan to do around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-name-is-ron-becker&quot;&gt;My name is Ron Becker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I love to learn about, talk about, and share information about a variety of fields. You may run across posts covering everything from CyberSec, SysAdmin, Linux, Web Development, and more. My interests, and hobbies are luckily pretty varied. Unlike my skill set… I have been working with computers, coding, and various IT and SysAdmin jobs for the last 12 years or so. Surprisingly I still suck at it all, and don’t know very much. But, this blog is how I intend to change that. If I force myself to write about and use the knowledge I gather I hope that it will “stick” a little better, and I will get better at putting it into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that something in here will help you, or someone you know on their journey to learn more as well!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ron Becker</name></author><category term="News and Updates" /><summary type="html">You’re probably wondering where the hell you’ve ended up.</summary></entry></feed>
