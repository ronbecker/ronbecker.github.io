# What is the Sparrowhawk Project?

The Sparrowhawk Project is meant to be a place for creating, and sharing information about, FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). We currently only have one project in the works, and that is the [Sparrowhawk Framework](https://github.io/sparrowhawkproject/Sparrowhawk). It is a CSS, and JavaScript framework meant to make creating websites quicker, and easier. Sadly, the repo hasn't been updated just yet. That is coming soon. However, more are on the way.

If you would like to contribute be sure to check the [Contributing Guidelines](). We would be more than happy to have you as part of any of our projects!

If you need to contact us for any reason, or want to be part of the Sparrowhawk Project feel free to send us an email at: contact.sparrowhawk@proton.me
