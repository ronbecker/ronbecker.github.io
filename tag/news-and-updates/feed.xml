      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/welcome">&lt;h2 id=&quot;youre-probably-wondering-where-the-hell-youve-ended-up&quot;&gt;You’re probably wondering where the hell you’ve ended up.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a very, very good question. Now is your chance to run off to Google, or Reddit. Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you actually stuck around? I’m sorry… now you are doomed to reading this garbage. Well, since you’re here I may as well explain who I am, and what I plan to do around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-name-is-ron-becker&quot;&gt;My name is Ron Becker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I love to learn about, talk about, and share information about a variety of fields. You may run across posts covering everything from CyberSec, SysAdmin, Linux, Web Development, and more. My interests, and hobbies are luckily pretty varied. Unlike my skill set… I have been working with computers, coding, and various IT and SysAdmin jobs for the last 12 years or so. Surprisingly I still suck at it all, and don’t know very much. But, this blog is how I intend to change that. If I force myself to write about and use the knowledge I gather I hope that it will “stick” a little better, and I will get better at putting it into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that something in here will help you, or someone you know on their journey to learn more as well!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
